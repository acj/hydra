Hydra Porting from Perl to Java Notes (Karli Lopez):

- object parsing is no longer required since the object is already deemed "parsed"

- the Error checker visitor is no longer needed as well (same reason)

- everything else in HydraV.pl except SetNever() and Accept() can be removed.

- are modelbody, classbody nodes necessary? Are they even present in the Java?

- toHilVisitor classes resemble UML specs more closely

ASTVisitorForPromela:
 -PassOutputFileName() no longer needed
 -SetNever() at first glance seems to be very important!!! what's more it
    needs to call Spin for its execution.  However this may become part 
    of a separate class
 
 -visitmodelNode() does absolutely nothing! (!?!?)


Java->Perl class relations:
Model      -> modelNode
           -> modelbodyNode
visitModel -> visitmodelbodyNodePak (visitor)

Class      -> ClassNode
           -> classbodyNode
visitClass -> visitclassbodyNodePak (visitor)
