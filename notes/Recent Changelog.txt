Hil2PromelaVisitor.java (Rev 1.15->1.17):
in public void sbnhOutputTransitions():
- hasGuards boolean variable created to let sbnhOutputGuardEnd() know
  that there is at least one guard present in the even being processed.

Hil2PromelaVisitor.java (Rev 1.14->1.15):
- added hasGuard to:
  "public AcceptReturnType sbnhOutputGuard(TransitionBodyNode transRef,
  boolean hasEvent, AcceptReturnType hasGuardParam, boolean isFirstGuard)"

Hil2PromelaVisitor.java (Rev 1.13->1.14):
- Fixed bug with state time invariants where the global stateTimeInvariant
  variable was getting cleared before the State visitor that needed it
  was done using it.
    * visitEventNode() after "String tmpStateTimeInvariant" declaration.
    * sbnhOutputTransitions after "String stTimeInvariant" declaration both after
      "for (int j = 0; j < tlvec.size(); j++)" and "if (evtNodeSrc.equals("NOEVENT"))"
    * new clear statement added to end of "visitStateBodyNode".


- Fixed bug in state Time invariant code generation which generated
  invalid Promela code when handling event read statements:
    * visitEventNode() after "if (tmpStateTimeInvariant.length() > 0)"
      which follows "String tmpStateTimeInvariant" declaration mentioned above.

- Fixed bug in which Guards were being printed where there was no need to do so.
  Solved by creating the hasGuard variable and making it local in scope only for 
  each transition for a given event. 
    * created code in sbnhOutputTransitions for non-empty transition handler
    * "public AcceptReturnType sbnhOutput_Dest(StateBodyNode tNode, String 
      dest, /* String optlDestID, */String destType,boolean hasGuard, boolean
      checkMTypeList)" and all other sbnhOutput_Dest overridden declarations.
    * Also modified: sbnhOutputActionMsgs, sbnhOutputGuardEnd
