  	* Convert HIL into Promela
+ Check identifiers to verify that they have been defined
+ Add support for ENUM statements
+ Add support for increment/decrement operators
+ Support for simple timers
+ Review the LTL parser and genericLex lexing code

+ Implement a test suite

+ Look into function calls on other classes (processes).  Does it work?  The Ford model needs it.  It uses the convention ClassName.OperName() to make the call.
